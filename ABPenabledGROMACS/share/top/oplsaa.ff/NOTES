Atom types exist (atomtypes.atp)

 opls_393   30.97376  ; P    dimethylphosphate anion  UA - see #440 for AA

 opls_394   15.99940  ; O(=) dimethylphosphate anion  UA - see #440 for AA

 opls_395   15.99940  ; O(-) dimethylphosphate anion  UA - see #440 for AA

bond params (ffbonded.itp)

  O     P       1    0.14800   439320.0   ;
 looks like this is the same for all O- and O=
 i guess they are all 394 types?

charges are set in aminoacids.rtp

...bond angles? diheds?

there is this in ffbonded
  HO     OH     P       1   108.500    376.560   ; SUG(OL)
...infact there are several entries here. 

1) build the aminoacids.rtp entry and conform to opls_number scheme
2) check ffbonded for binds, angles, etc 

...looks like P-all bonds are defined in ffbonded. ffnon- has LJ and charges, which I fixed.

Things look good but I need to rename the O2 atoms as they might be read as terminal
