i) Run your configure command with whatever options you need to use. You MUST use --prefix=PATH-TO-THIS-DIRECTORY unles you want to manage links to mdrun in the Run-METHOD directories for your slef.

ii) Run "make clean"

iii) compile hello.f in src/kernel with gfortran -O3 -fbounds-check -c hello.f

iiii) Make these two changes to src/kernel/Makefile

1) Line 144 should read:
	md_openmm.$(OBJEXT) hello.o 
2) Line 232 should read:
LIBS = -lnsl -lm -lgfortran 

iiiii) run "make" and "make install" from the same directory you ran configure


Next you need to build a tpr file to run.

Go to the ALANINEsystem directory and use:
../bin/grompp -f md.mdp -c isob.gro -t isob.cpt -o ala.tpr

This will build a file "ala.tpr" Each time you build this file, the thermostat state will change.

Copy this file into the Run-mABP, Run-WTmetaD, Run-SHUSish directories to run simulations.


Finally, you can run with: 
./mdrun -v -deffnm ala 
If you are on a compute cluster submitting to a queue, then you will need something more. This is between you and your cluster support.
